### Fetch data from multiple apis and organize into a form that can be used for analytics.

### Goal is to start very simply, and iterate from there.

### The example that is currently in the example folder I'm actually not heavily using as an example - I don't like the static classes used in config and util, but I did think the lazy evaluation-style approach with the static init was kind of interesting.

### Initial APIS:
1. QUANDL
2. DB NOMICS
